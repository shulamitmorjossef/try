This repository is part of the academic course - Numerical-Analysis in [SCE - Shamoon College of Engineering](https://sce.ac.il).

The repo contains an implementation of methods that will be learned within the course to solve numerical analysis problems. Each method has an explanation in a PDF file and a runnable example to assist in understanding and applying these methods. 

## Implemented Methods
The following numerical methods are currently implemented in this repository:

#### Methods for Solving Linear Systems of Equations:
1. Gauss elimination
2. LU factorization
3. Gauss Seidel
4. Jacobi
5. SOR - Successive Over Relaxation
   
#### Roots Finding -Iterative Methods for Nonlinear Systems :
1. The Bisection method.
2. Newton Raphson method.
3. Secant method.

#### Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation:
1. Linear Interpolation
2. Polynomial Interpolation
3. LaGrange
4. Neville
5. Cubic Spline

#### Numerical Integration methods:
1. Romberg
2. Simpson
3. Trapezoid
4. Gaussian Quadrature
